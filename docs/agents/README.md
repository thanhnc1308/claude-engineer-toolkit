# Agents

- Defines persistent persona and behavioral constitution.
  - Who you are (identity, expertise)
  - How you behave (principles, values, tone)
  - What you care about (priorities, non-negotiables)
  - References to skills for procedural knowledge

- Defines how the agent thinks and operates for its entire lifetime.
- It's not a step-by-step procedure — it's more like a job description. The agent reads it once at startup and it shapes all its decisions throughout the task.
- In a subagent, the body answers: "How should this agent think and behave?"
