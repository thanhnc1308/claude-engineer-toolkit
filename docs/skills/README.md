# Skills

[**Agent Skills**](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) are specialized workflows including instructions, metadata, and optional resources (scripts, templates) that extend Claude's functionality.

- Procedural workflow — essentially a recipe Claude reads on-demand and follows for a specific task. It's much more prescriptive and step-by-step, and often references other files or scripts to load progressively.
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Checklists and patterns
  - Code examples and templates
  - Decision trees and workflows

- In a SKILL.md, the body answers: "What exact steps should Claude follow to complete this task?"
