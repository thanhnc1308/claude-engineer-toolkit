# Prompt

I need to build an AI assistant that remembers user preferences, past conversations, and learned patterns across sessions. Design a memory architecture that balances retrieval accuracy with token efficiency.

# Expected

- [ ] Distinguishes between in-context and external memory
- [ ] Recommends cross-session persistence strategies
- [ ] Addresses retrieval/selection mechanisms (Select bucket)
- [ ] Mentions knowledge graphs or structured memory
- [ ] Balances memory retrieval with token budget
- [ ] Suggests caching strategy (70%+ hit rate target)
- [ ] References memory-systems.md for detailed architecture
- [ ] May mention compression for long-term storage
