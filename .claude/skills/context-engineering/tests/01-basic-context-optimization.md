# Prompt

My Claude agent is hitting context limits after 10-15 exchanges. What strategies should I implement to extend conversation length while maintaining response quality?

# Expected

- [ ] Explains token utilization thresholds (70% warning, 80% trigger)
- [ ] Recommends compaction/summarization strategy
- [ ] Mentions the four-bucket strategy (Write, Select, Compress, Isolate)
- [ ] Suggests progressive disclosure or just-in-time loading
- [ ] Warns against placing critical info in middle positions
