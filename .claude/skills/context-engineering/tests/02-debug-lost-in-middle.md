# Prompt

My agent consistently ignores instructions I place in the middle of long system prompts. It follows the beginning and end perfectly but misses middle sections. How do I diagnose and fix this?

# Expected

- [ ] Identifies "lost-in-middle" degradation pattern
- [ ] Explains U-shaped attention curve (beginning/end favored)
- [ ] Recommends restructuring critical info to beginning/end positions
- [ ] Suggests context partitioning or chunking
- [ ] May reference context-degradation.md for detailed patterns
